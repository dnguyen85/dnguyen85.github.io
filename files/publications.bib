abstract = {In recent years, several experimental studies have come out to validate the theoretical findings of interference alignment (IA), but only a handful of studies have focused on blind interference alignment. Unlike IA and other interference mitigation techniques, blind IA does not require channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The key insight is that the transmitter uses the knowledge of channel coherence intervals and receivers utilize reconfigurable antennas to create channel fluctuations exploited by the transmitter. In this work, we present a novel experimental evaluation of a reconfigurable antenna system for achieving blind IA. We present a blind IA technique based on reconfigurable antennas for a 2-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel implemented on a software defined radio platform where each of the receivers is equipped with a reconfigurable antenna. We further compare this blind IA implementation with traditional TDMA scheme for benchmarking purposes. We show that the achievable rates for blind IA can be realized in practice using measured channels under practical channel conditions. Additionally, the average error vector magnitude and bit error rate (BER) performances are evaluated.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous wireless small-cell deployment requires a fundamental rethink of interference management within the cell, between cells, and with overlaying macrocells. One mean to increase spectral efficiency in these scenarios is through simultaneous directional transmissions and receptions, wherein the antenna directions can be selected such that the overall interference is minimized, or some other cost function is satisfied. To realistically evaluate the performance of these beamsteering techniques, network simulators or testbeds are often required. Nevertheless, a capable testbed that covers sufficient small-cell operational aspects and incorporates directional antennas has yet to be found in the literature. In this paper we present WARP-TDMAC, a software-defined radio framework to enable the prototyping of directionality-based spectrum sharing schemes for small cells. WARP-TDMAC integrates compact pattern-reconfigurable antennas with a high performance 802.11 physical layer and uses a time division multiple access (TDMA) based medium access control (MAC) scheme for antenna direction scheduling. We characterize the synchronization and temporal/spatial scheduling capabilities of this testbed through several example MAC schemes that would have been difficult to realize without our cross-layer framework. The empirical results show that appropriate use of directionality can result in higher network sum rates in dense small-cell deployments, but further investigation is required to find an effective solution for this highly complex operational environment.},

abstract = {Widespread deployment of indoor wireless LANs has brought about many advantages, but at the same time posed tremendous challenges for interference management and service scalability. One means to improve wireless capacity in dense deployments is through simultaneous directional transmissions and receptions, but there has yet to be a coordinated approach that can adapt well to fast-changing channel conditions. In this demonstration we present a distributed directional antenna system to enhance spatial reuse in indoor scenarios. Our system is a holistic approach combining smart antennas, synchronous channel access, and an adaptive antenna beamsteering mechanism. We implement this system on software-defined radios and demonstrate the feasibility of dense spatial packing to maximize the network sum rate.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of reactive adversarial jamming on the performance of 802.11 wireless networks. We present our development prototype of a real-time capable, channel-aware, reactive jammer using GNU Radio and the USRP N210 software-defined radio (SDR) platform. Our jammer is capable of detecting in-flight packets of known wireless standards and reacting to jam themâ€”within 80 ns of detecting the signal. This capability demonstrates that reactive jamming is a serious wireless security threat that can be achieved using low-cost, readily available hardware. We study the effects of three types of jamming on 802.11 networks by conducting iperf UDP bandwidth measurements. The results demonstrates that our system works reliably in real time as a reactive jammer and can be used as a research instrument for a wide range of wireless standards.},

abstract = {This paper develops a programmable hardware implementation of the physical layer for cognitive wireless communication systems that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes. Data-flows within hardware implemented baseband architectures for all communication standards are quite regular in nature, thereby enabling the construction of fast, synchronized and optimized baseband systems on FPGAs. We designed an OFDM pipeline comprising codec, modulation, interleaving, piloting, channel estimation, and IFFT stages in which each stage can be configured at design time or at run time to accommodate different communication standards as well as different configuration settings for a single standard-a key feature necessary for dynamic spectrum sensing and utilization. This flexibility in hardware is achieved by designing each individual stage with room for scaling/modification and having the overall pipeline be insensitive to the latencies incurred by individual pipeline stages. This is done by using stallable stages with centralized control through cross communication between modules both directly and indirectly using code running on the MicroBlaze processor. The OFDM pipeline is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA and its performance is characterized in terms of functional correctness and FPGA implementation area cost. Experimental results and preliminary simulations of our FPGA based design can run at flexible coding rates of 1/2 and 3/4 with modulation schemes of 4QAM and 16QAM respectively.},

abstract = {Wireless research and education are often hindered by the fact that RF electromagnetic signals are invisible and therefore hard to visualize. Domain-specific software, such as those used for antenna radiation pattern measurements, has significantly enhanced the level of radiation visualization through interactive 3D plots. However, the intuition stops there and does not carry over into the real-word operational environment of antennas and radios. As a result, there exists a real disconnect in visualization between the available antenna radiation patterns and their effects on wireless network performance. In this demo1 we present BeamViewer, an augmented reality framework to help visualize and capture the dynamic radiation patterns of reconfigurable antennas in real time. BeamViewer takes inputs from the cognitive radios controlling beam-steerable antennas and annotates on a live-view mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns. This capability adds an unprecedented level of instant visualization and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a reconfigurable antenna-based cognitive radio network.},

abstract = {With the increasing programmability and fast-paced dynamics of modern wireless systems, it has become more difficult to gain timely insights into wireless network operations. In this demonstration we present WiART, an augmented reality framework to help visualize and interact with wireless network activities in real time. WiART collects real-time radio and network statistics from participating network devices and depicts them on users' mobile devices in an intuitive way, leveraging the virtual information overlay of augmented reality. Specifically in our current implementation, WiART takes inputs from a cognitive radio link controlling beam-steerable reconfigurable antennas and annotates on a live mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns. In the reverse flow, WiART enables users to select desired antenna radiation patterns directly in the mobile app and observe their effects on link performance in real time. These capabilities add an unprecedented level of instant visualization and interaction with wireless activities and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a reconfigurable antenna-based cognitive radio network.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing concerns in the world today. Recent global events show the need for more strict measures to protect the public from cyber attacks, which has triggered an increased demand for cybersecurity professionals. Many academic institutions began offering courses covering current cybersecurity con- cepts to satisfy this need. Although these courses educate students with proper skills, they lack the connection to current advancements in academic research: A more encompassing curriculum is a must in this rapidly growing field. For the most up-to-date education, we developed a course that takes a student-centric hands-on approach supported with Software Defined Radios to study current cybersecurity research projects in wireless networks. Our course consists of short lectures followed by lab sessions, where students implement security algorithms described by the standards or by recent peer-reviewed research articles. Our results indicate that students appreciate the mixture of textbook and research topics being covered in the course and they feel more prepared for any future task in the cybersecurity field. Although taking a detour from the textbook applies additional strain to educators, our paper shows that including current research practices in curriculum development efforts is a good investment towards a better educational outcome.},
