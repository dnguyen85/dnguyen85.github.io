Hi. I'm Danh Nguyen, 
a final-year PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering
at [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu/).
<!-- -->
My research areas 
focus on _wireless communications and networking_,
specifically the application
of advanced physical layer techniques,
such as smart antennas, MIMO beamforming,
and reactive responses
to improve network throughputs.

I am a member of [Drexel Wireless Systems Lab](http://wireless.ece.drexel.edu),
co-advised by 
Drs. [Kapil R. Dandekar](http://drexel.edu/ece/contact/faculty-directory/DandekarKapil/) 
and [Naga Kandasamy](http://www.ece.drexel.edu/kandasamy/)


I hold a M.S. ('14) and B.S. ('09)
